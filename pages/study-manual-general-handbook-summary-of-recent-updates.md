“Summary of Recent Updates,” General Handbook.

# Summary of Recent Updates

## August 2023

Throughout the handbook, the phrases “ _the_ work of salvation and exaltation”
and “ _the Lord’s_ work of salvation and exaltation” have been changed to “
_God’s_ work of salvation and exaltation” to emphasize that we are invited to
participate in God’s work.

Revised language throughout the handbook to reflect that family history
centers are now called FamilySearch centers and the Family History Library is
now called the FamilySearch Library.
